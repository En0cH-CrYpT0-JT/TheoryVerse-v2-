# Security Policy

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

The TheoryVerse project takes security seriously.  
If you discover a security vulnerability or a weakness that could impact users, systems, or downstream projects, please report it **responsibly**.

### ✅ How to Report

Please **do not open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report issues via one of the following methods:

- **Email:** en0ch24@proton.me

- **GitHub (Private):**  
  If available, use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact or exploitation scenario
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code

## 🕒 Response Expectations

- **Initial acknowledgment:** within 72 hours  
- **Assessment & triage:** as soon as reasonably possible

As an independent open-source project, response times may vary, but all good-faith reports will be reviewed.

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue
- Avoid public disclosure until a fix or mitigation is available
- Act in good faith and avoid data destruction or privacy violations

Responsible disclosure helps protect users and the wider community.

## ⚠️ Scope Notes

This project may include:
- Experimental code
- Research implementations
- Conceptual or theoretical models

Not all components are production-hardened.  
Security reports should focus on **realistic risk**, not purely theoretical or speculative concerns.

## 🛡️ Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research.

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act responsibly
- Avoid harm, data exfiltration, or service disruption
- Follow the reporting process described above
